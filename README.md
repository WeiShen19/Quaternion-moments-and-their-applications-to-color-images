# Quaternion moments and their applications to color images
## Overview
#### The codes are corresponding to a chapter “Quaternion moments and their applications to color images” of an open-access edited book titled “Recent Progress in Image Moments and Moment Invariants”. The book will be published by Science Gate Publishing. These codes are performed in Matlab2017.

## Description of the codes
#### (1)	The codes are based on a toolbox “qtfm” provided by Dr S. J. Sangwine et al. (http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~sjs/). Please add it to path before performing codes;

#### (2)	To implement Quaternion Zernike Moment Invariants, please run Main_QZMIs.m in the folder “Quaternion Zernike Moment Invariants”;

#### (3)	To implement Quaternion-type Moments, please run Main _QTMs.m in the folder “Quaternion-type Moments”;

#### (4)	To implement Quaternion Gyrator Transofrm, please run QGT.m;


#### (5)	For Quaternion Bessel-Fourier Moments and Its Descriptor, see folder QBFMs for details. To compute QBFMs, please run QBFMs_Decomposing.m;To compute quaternion Bessel-Fourier moments, please run QBFMD_Fast.m.
